~~~

### Fields

Inside the comments loop, use `[comment]` to display the following fields.

> **content** - comment content; default if not parameter is specified

> **date** - date of comment

> **date_format** - format the comment date, e.g., "Y-m-d". See [the codex](http://codex.wordpress.org/Formatting_Date_and_Time) for date format syntax.

### Count and input form

*Display comment input form*

~~~
[comment form]
~~~

*Display number of comments for the current post*

~~~
Number of comments: [comment count]
~~~

You can also display the total comment count *after* a loop is finished:

~~~
Total number of comments: [comment total]
~~~



&nbsp;

### If post has comment

Use `[if comment]` to display something if the current post has any comments or not.

*Display comment count if the post has comment*

~~~
[loop type=post category=news]
  [if comment]
    [comment count]
  [else]
    No comment yet.
  [/if]
[/loop]
~~~


&nbsp;

### Template

You can also display comments of the current post using the theme's comment template.

*Display comment list using template*

~~~
Comment list: [comment template]
~~~

By default, the comments list is displayed by *comments.php* in the theme directory. If you want to specify a different template:

~~~
[comment template=short-comments.php]
~~~

This will look for the comments template in the child theme first, then in the parent theme.
