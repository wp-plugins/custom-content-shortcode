[else]
  Regular Price
[/if]
~~~

## Date field
---

You can use the parameters *before* and *after* to compare dates.

*If post was published in the last 2 weeks*

~~~
[if field=date after='2 weeks ago']
  New post
[else]
  Old post
[/if]
~~~

The value can be a specific date like *2015-02-01*, or a relative date such as *1 month ago*.

## Other conditions
---

### If there is no loop result

Use `[if empty]` to display something when there is no post matching the query.

*Display a message for no query result*

~~~
[loop type=events category=weekend]
  [field title]
  [field description]
  [if empty]
    There is no event for this category.
  [/if]
[/loop]
~~~

If there's no post found, the loop displays what's inside `[if empty]` only once.

---

### For every X number of posts

*Add an extra break line for every 3 posts*


~~~
[loop type=post count=9]
  [field title]
  [if every=3]
    <br>
  [/if]
[/loop]
~~~

*Display something for the first and last post*

~~~
[loop type=post]
  [field title]
  [if first]
    first post
  [/if]
  [if last]
    last post
  [/if]
[/loop]
~~~

---

### If a field value exists

To check if a field has any value, use the *field* parameter.

*Display only products that have serial numbers*


~~~
[loop type=product]
  [if field=serial_number]
    Product: [field title]
    Serial #: [field serial_number]
  [/if]
[/loop]
~~~

If you specify the *value* parameter, it will check for that specific value only.

---

### If a taxonomy term exists

To check if the post has any term in a given taxonomy, use the *taxonomy* parameter without specifying the term.

*Display tags if any exists*


~~~
[loop type=book]
  Book: [field title]
  Author: [field author_name]
  [if taxonomy=tag]
    Tags:
    [for each=tag trim=true]
      [each name-link],
    [/for]
  [else]
    There's no tag.
  [/if]
[/loop]
~~~

## Nested
---

For nested conditions, use the minus prefix.

~~~
[loop type=product]
  [if category=books]
    The book [field title-link] is
    [-if field=status value=in-stock]
      in stock.
      [-else]
      not available.
    [/-if]
  [else]
    [field title-link] is not a book.
  [/if]
[/loop]
~~~

You can add up to 3 prefixes.
