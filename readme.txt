== Description ==

= Overview =
<br />
From a single field to entire pages, Custom Content Shortcode is a set of commands to display content where you need.

The **[content]** shortcode displays any of the following: *posts, pages, custom post types, fields, images, menus,* or *widget areas*.

The **[loop]** shortcode performs query loops. It can display, for example, available products in a category, or excerpts from the 5 most recent posts. You can query by parameters such as: *post type, taxonomy, date,* and *field values*.

There is a reference section under Settings -> Custom Content.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

**Q:** How do I protect shortcodes from post content formatting?

**A:** Post content is automatically formatted, which can cause unwanted `<p>` and `<br>` tags inside multi-line shortcodes. To prevent this, wrap the section with the [raw] shortcode. You can enable it under Settings -> Custom Content.

**Q:** How do I protect HTML code from the visual editor?

**A:** The visual editor (TinyMCE) sometimes misinterprets HTML tags placed in the text editor. There are several ways to address this issue.

* Use the built-in HTML block shortcodes. See under Settings.

* Disable the visual editor for specific posts or post types, with the [Raw HTML](http://wordpress.org/plugins/raw-html/) plugin. However, if the post needs to be editable by the client, this won't be ideal.

* Put the code in a custom post type, then include it into the post. For example: *[content type="template" name="recent-posts"]*

* Put the code in a custom field, then include it in the post. For example: *[field code_block]*

* Put the code in a file, then include it into the post. For example: *[load dir="views" file="recent-posts.html"]*

* Put your code in a text widget, and use a plugin like [Widgets on Pages](http://wordpress.org/plugins/widgets-on-pages/).
